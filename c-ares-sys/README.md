Bindings for [`c-ares`](http://c-ares.haxx.se/), mostly autogenerated by [`rust-bindgen`](https://github.com/crabtw/rust-bindgen).

To create `ffi.rs`, do this:

    bindgen -l cares -match ares -o src/ffi.rs /usr/include/ares.h

... and then:

- add a few type definitions for OS types at the top of the file
    - Compare wth the current version to see what's needed
- add `unsafe` to the function type declarations for `ares_sock_state_cb`, `ares_callback`, `ares_host_callback`, `ares_nameinfo_callback`, `ares_sock_create_callback`
    - Any non-trivial implementations of these callbacks will involve de-referencing raw pointer parameters
- remove `ares_fds` and `ares_process`
    - These both use `fd_set`.  
    - Cursory search didn't find an existing Rust representation of this structure
    - Since the high-level API doesn't use either of these functions, it's simplest just to pretend they're not there
- add a few type definitions for OS types at the top of the file.
